Mage

Brother / Sister to Matt's character. Shaman from the streets. Thinks tech is cool, but has no hardware.  Still loves guns. Especially his Ares Predator.  Might not be smartlinked, but man it packs a punch. And no one ever expects the mage to be carrying... Or maybe a sawed off shotgun. Either way, when a spell fails, you eat LEAD.
